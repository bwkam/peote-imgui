following this
https://github.com/flyover/imgui-js/blob/master/example/src/main.ts

1. master -> renderPart approach
2. custom_display -> a custom display approach

neither work at the moment

it uses flyover/imgui-js which provides bindings for both canvas and webgl, so little effort has to be done to hook it up with peote
